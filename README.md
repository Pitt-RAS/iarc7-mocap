This repository is part of the Pitt RAS effort for IARC Mission 7.  For an overview of the IARC competition as well as the team's efforts and technical approaches, check out our [team website](http://pittras.org/projects/IARC/), and in particular the [technical postmortem post for the project](http://pittras.org/projects/iarc/2018/08/10/update-iarc-technical-postmortem.html).

It contains a motion capture system which uses Gaussian Mixture Modeling to detect the drone in the foreground of an image and track its location.
